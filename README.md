This application is a virtual Queue Management system.

## Users

The image below shows a brief overview of each user's flow through the application.

Below are details about the various classes of users and their functionality. We have 4 classes of users: visitor, owner, employee, admin.

### Visitor user

Username: `user`, password: `user`

On signing up/logging in, you will be redirected to the store searching page. Here you can search for stores using the search function, the filtering, or by navigating the map and clicking on a marker. Note that the black marker represents your location, and the other markers represent store locations. Once you have selected a store, you can click on Join Queue to join the queue, or View Data to view analytics about the store. If you clicked on View Data, you will now see analytics information about the store. You can either go back to store search by clicking on Back or decide to Join Queue. Clicking Join Queue here amounts to the same as clicking it on store search. Joining the queue takes you to the queue status page. Here you can view information about your status in the queue such as your predicted waiting time to reach the front of the queue, number of people in the queue/store, and a small visualization of your position in the queue. We also have a map preview of where you are and where the store is in case you're not currently at the store. You'll see an announcement show up if the queue managers need to inform you of anything. When the managers want you to call you to the store, you'll be notified by a message from the store. When you're called to the store, you must then click display QR to show your QR code to the manager. You can also click exit queue to exit the queue at any time.

### Owner user

Username: `user1`, password: `user1`

When you sign up as a store owner you will be given default credentials for your store. you must visit the settings page to customize it. Once logging in/signing up, you will be redirected to the queue dashboard page where you can view information about the queue for your store and some quick stats about the store. You can go to your store's analytics at any point by clicking on store analytics. You also have various controls over your store such as emptying its queue, marking a customer as exited, etc. You will see two lists of users, the first one shows you only one visitor, the visitor you most recently accepted so you may undo any mistaken clicks, and a list of currently waiting visitors in the queue. You can at any time choose to announce something to all users by using the Send Announcement button. You have various controls for the users in the waiting queue. You can reject any user in the queue or choose to notify them that they must present themselves soon. Once notified, you may choose to accept them which brings up a QR code reader to read the visitor's QR code. If the QR code was valid, a green message saying so will pop up. If not, a red message saying so will pop up. You can choose to let the user inside or reject the user from the QR popup.

### Employee user

Username: `user2`, password: `user2`

When you sign up/log in as an employee, you will be redirected to your store's queue dashboard. A notification may pop up saying you have no store set to your account. If this is the case you must ask your store's owner to add your username to their employee list in their account. Once that's done you will be able to view the store's dashboard. The rest of the flow from here is the same as the owner user. The only difference is that you may not view/edit the store's settings.

### Admin user

Username: `admin`, password: `admin`

When you log in as an admin, you will see the admin panel page. Here you can search for users, stores using the filter functionality and edit a user/store at any point. This brings up a popup where you will have to make your changes and then save them.
